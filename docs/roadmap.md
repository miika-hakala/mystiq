# Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Landing + Waitlist

- Landing page with value proposition and brand preview
- Email waitlist capture
- Social proof / community interest validation
- Establish brand presence

## Phase 1 — MVP (PWA)

- Core features: text analyzer, cipher detector, hint brainstormer, coordinate checker
- Field Quick Mode UX
- PWA: installable, fast launch, offline basics
- Freemium + Pro subscription billing
- Launch to waitlist, iterate on feedback

## Phase 2 — Native Wrapper + Image Helper

- Wrap PWA in native shell (iOS/Android) for app store distribution
- Light image analysis: extract text from puzzle images, detect visual patterns
- Enhanced offline capabilities
- Push notifications (e.g., "new puzzle type supported")
- Expanded cipher/encoding library

## Phase 3 — Expansions

- Workspace: save puzzles, organize by cache, track progress
- Training mode: learn cipher types and solving techniques
- Community puzzle packs (curated, non-geocaching-specific practice puzzles)
- Advanced coordinate tools (projection, waypoint calculations)
- Potential API integrations (only if ToS-safe and community-approved)

## Guiding Principles

- Ship small, learn fast
- Community sentiment is a first-class metric
- Never sacrifice the "assistant" positioning for feature velocity
