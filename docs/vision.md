# Vision

## Problem

Mystery caches are the most intellectually rewarding — and the most frustrating — part of geocaching. Solvers often hit walls: unrecognized cipher types, unfamiliar encoding schemes, or simply not knowing where to start. Existing tools are scattered, generic, and don't understand the geocaching context.

## Audience

- Active geocachers who regularly attempt mystery/puzzle caches
- Solvers ranging from intermediate to advanced who want a smarter workflow
- Field geocachers who need quick analysis on the go

## Why Now

- LLM and pattern-recognition capabilities have matured enough to meaningfully assist puzzle analysis
- PWA technology enables near-native mobile experience without app store friction
- No focused, geocaching-aware puzzle assistant exists in the market

## Success Criteria

- Users solve mysteries they previously abandoned
- Measurable reduction in time-to-first-insight on new puzzles
- Positive community sentiment: seen as a helpful tool, not a cheat
- Sustainable recurring revenue via Pro subscriptions

## Non-Goals

- Replace the puzzle-solving experience or remove the challenge
- Become a "press button, get coordinates" tool
- Integrate directly with Geocaching.com APIs (ToS risk)
- Provide social/competitive features in early phases
