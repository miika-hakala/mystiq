# Positioning

## Positioning Statement

For geocachers who tackle mystery caches, MystiQ is an AI-powered puzzle assistant that helps you analyze patterns, detect encodings, and brainstorm approaches — so you can solve more puzzles while keeping the challenge intact.

Unlike generic cipher tools or brute-force solvers, MystiQ understands geocaching context, works in the field, and respects the spirit of the game.

## Messaging Guardrails

### Allowed Language

- assistant, analyzer, brainstorm companion, puzzle partner, thinking tool
- hints, patterns, approaches, observations, suggestions
- analyze, decode, explore, reveal patterns, brainstorm
- "helps you think," "expands what you can consider," "reduces dead ends"

### Forbidden Framing

- solver, cracker, cheat tool, auto-solve, hack, bypass
- answers, solutions, coordinates, results
- "solve instantly," "auto decode coordinates," "get the answer," "find coordinates"
- any implication that MystiQ removes the need to think

The product helps users *think better*, not *think less*.

### Boundary Examples

| Instead of... | Say... |
|---|---|
| "Solve this puzzle" | "Analyze this puzzle" |
| "Crack this code" | "Decode this pattern" |
| "Get the answer" | "Explore possibilities" |
| "Find the coordinates" | "Check coordinate format" |
| "Auto-decode" | "Detect encoding type" |

## Sample Microcopy

- "Analyze" — not "Solve"
- "Decode" — not "Crack"
- "Reveal patterns" — not "Get answer"
- "Brainstorm approaches" — not "Find solution"
- "Check coordinates" — not "Extract coordinates"

### Example UI Strings

- "Let's look at what we're working with..."
- "I notice some patterns here — want to explore them?"
- "This could be [cipher type]. Here's how you might approach it."
- "Your coordinates look valid, but digit 4 seems unusual for this region."
