# Monetization

## Revenue Strategy

MystiQ is a **cashflow niche micro-SaaS**. The goal is sustainable recurring revenue from a well-defined niche, not venture-scale growth.

- Target market: geocachers who solve mystery caches (dedicated hobbyist niche)
- Revenue model: subscription + one-time lifetime option
- Growth model: organic (community, word-of-mouth, SEO) — not paid acquisition
- NOT a VC/unicorn target — profitability > growth rate

## Pricing Philosophy

**Freemium → Pro → Lifetime** ladder:

- **Free tier** exists to let users experience value before paying. Generous enough to be useful, limited enough to create clear upgrade motivation.
- **Pro subscription (€7–10/mo)** is the core revenue driver. Priced to be an easy "yes" for an active hobbyist — less than a day of geocaching expenses.
- **Lifetime (€39–49)** rewards early adopters, generates upfront cashflow during launch, and builds loyalty. Equivalent to ~5–6 months of Pro — attractive for committed users.

## Model: Freemium + Pro Subscription + Lifetime

### Free Tier

- Limited analyses per day (e.g., 5/day)
- Basic cipher detection (common encodings only)
- Coordinate format checker
- Field Quick Mode (limited uses)
- Local history (last 10 analyses)

### Pro Subscription — €7–10/month

- Unlimited analyses
- Full cipher/encoding library
- Advanced hint brainstormer (deeper pattern analysis)
- Priority processing
- Extended local history
- Early access to new features

### Lifetime — €39–49 (one-time)

- All Pro features, forever
- Available during early-access / launch period
- Rewards early adopters and builds initial cashflow
- May be retired or repriced after launch window
