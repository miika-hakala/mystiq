# Brand

## Brand DNA

- **AI:** Intelligent, capable, cutting-edge — the tool feels smart
- **Puzzle/Cipher:** Mystery, patterns, hidden layers, the thrill of decoding
- **Mystery:** Intrigue, discovery, the unknown — something waiting to be uncovered
- **Geocaching context:** Outdoor adventure backdrop; primarily conveyed through UX and content, not visual branding

## Name

**MystiQ** — the capital Q adds distinctiveness, hints at "question" and "quest," and works as a memorable app icon element.

## Visual Direction

- **Base:** Dark theme (near-black backgrounds)
- **Accents:** Neon cyan and violet, used sparingly for emphasis
- **Gradients:** Cyan-to-violet gradients for key UI elements and branding moments
- **Typography:** Clean, modern sans-serif; monospace for cipher/code display
- **Feel:** Premium, focused, slightly futuristic — like a high-end analysis tool

## Logo Guidance

- **Preferred concept:** Orbital Q — a stylized Q with an orbital ring or arc element
- **Qualities:** Premium feel, works at app-icon size, distinctive silhouette
- **Small-size rules:**
  - Must be recognizable at 32×32 px
  - Single-color version must work (for favicons, mono contexts)
  - Avoid fine details that collapse at small sizes
  - The Q letterform should be the primary element; orbital detail is secondary
- **Color usage:** Primary in cyan or white on dark; gradient version for hero contexts

## Voice & Tone

- Knowledgeable but approachable
- Curious, not condescending
- Brief and useful, not chatty
- Excited about puzzles, respectful of the challenge
