# Brand

## Brand DNA

MystiQ's brand sits at the intersection of four pillars:

- **AI intelligence:** Cutting-edge, capable, precise — the tool feels smart and trustworthy
- **Mystery:** Intrigue, discovery, the unknown — something waiting to be uncovered
- **Puzzle/Cipher:** Patterns, hidden layers, the thrill of decoding — the core domain
- **Premium tech:** Modern, polished, professional — not a hobby project aesthetic

The brand deliberately avoids:

- Gimmick/cheat aesthetics (skull icons, "hack" language, dark-web vibes)
- Childish puzzle imagery (jigsaw pieces, question marks, cartoon magnifying glasses)
- Generic "AI assistant" blandness

## Name

**MystiQ** — the capital Q adds distinctiveness, hints at "question" and "quest," and works as a memorable app icon element.

## Visual Identity Direction (Locked)

- **Base:** Dark theme (near-black backgrounds) — premium, focused, reduces eye strain in field use
- **Accents:** Neon cyan and violet, used sparingly for emphasis and interactive elements
- **Gradients:** Cyan-to-violet gradients for key UI elements, branding moments, and hero contexts
- **Typography:** Clean, modern sans-serif for UI; monospace for cipher/code display
- **Feel:** Premium, focused, slightly futuristic — like a high-end analysis tool

This direction is locked per [DEC-006](decisions/dec-006-brand-and-visual-identity.md).

## Logo Direction (Locked)

### Preferred Concept: Orbital Q

A stylized Q with an orbital ring or arc element.

### Symbolism

- **Intelligence:** The orbital path suggests computation, analysis, processing
- **Mystery:** A ring around the unknown — something being examined, circled, explored
- **Signal / analysis:** Evokes radar, scanning, detection — core to what MystiQ does
- **Discovery:** Orbital motion implies progression toward a finding, not a static state

### Technical Requirements

- Must be recognizable at 32x32 px
- Single-color version must work (favicons, mono contexts)
- Avoid fine details that collapse at small sizes
- The Q letterform is the primary element; orbital detail is secondary
- Color usage: primary in cyan or white on dark; gradient version for hero contexts

### What the Logo is NOT

- Not a puzzle piece
- Not a magnifying glass
- Not a geocaching trackable or cache icon
- Not a generic AI brain/circuit motif

## Voice & Tone

- Knowledgeable but approachable
- Curious, not condescending
- Brief and useful, not chatty
- Excited about puzzles, respectful of the challenge
