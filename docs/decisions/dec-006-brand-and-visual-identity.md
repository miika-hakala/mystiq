# DEC-006 — brand and visual identity

**status:** accepted
**date:** 2026-02-24

## context

MystiQ requires a premium, modern identity aligned with:

- AI intelligence positioning
- Mystery/puzzle domain authenticity
- App-icon scalability (32x32 px minimum)
- Avoidance of gimmick/cheat aesthetics

Multiple logo concepts and visual directions were evaluated during the concept phase.

## decision

MystiQ adopts:

- **Orbital Q** logo direction — stylized Q with orbital ring/arc element
- **Dark + neon/electric** visual style — near-black base with cyan and violet accents
- **Premium tech/mystery** vibe — modern, polished, slightly futuristic

The logo symbolizes intelligence (orbital computation), mystery (circling the unknown), signal/analysis (scanning, detection), and discovery (progression toward a finding).

## rationale

- Strong icon scalability — the Q letterform works at all sizes, orbital detail is secondary
- Timeless vs puzzle cliches — avoids jigsaw pieces, magnifying glasses, generic AI motifs
- Matches assistant positioning — premium and trustworthy, not hacky or gimmicky
- Dark + neon is distinctive in the geocaching tool space (most tools use outdoorsy greens/browns)
- Cyan/violet palette works across dark UI, marketing materials, and app icon contexts

## consequences

Positive:

- Cohesive brand system from icon to full UI
- Consistent cross-platform identity (PWA, future native, marketing)
- Clear brand guidelines for any future design work

Tradeoffs:

- Dark theme requires careful contrast work for accessibility
- Neon accents must be used sparingly to avoid visual fatigue
