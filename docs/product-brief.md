# Product Brief

## One-Liner

MystiQ is an AI-powered puzzle assistant that helps geocachers analyze, decode, and brainstorm mystery caches — on the sofa or in the field.

## Core Value Proposition

**"When puzzles stop making sense."**

MystiQ is the thinking partner that helps you see what you're missing — not by solving for you, but by expanding what you can consider. It detects patterns you'd overlook, identifies encodings you don't recognize, and brainstorms angles you haven't tried.

## User Journeys

### Sofa Mode (Deep Analysis)

1. User pastes puzzle text, image description, or cache page notes into MystiQ
2. MystiQ analyzes the input: identifies potential puzzle type (cipher, numeric, coordinate trick, language puzzle, riddle)
3. User explores detected patterns — e.g., "This looks like ROT13 with a coordinate offset"
4. MystiQ suggests approaches and brainstorms angles, without giving direct answers
5. User iterates, applying hints and testing hypotheses at their own pace

### Field Mode (Quick Help)

1. User opens MystiQ on phone (PWA, fast launch)
2. Snaps a photo or pastes text from the field
3. MystiQ provides immediate analysis: encoding detection, coordinate format check, pattern hints
4. Minimal taps — designed for one-handed use, outdoor lighting, quick decisions
5. User gets unstuck and continues the hunt

## Key Differentiators

- **Sofa + Field duality:** No other tool serves both deep home analysis and fast field use. MystiQ owns both contexts.
- **AI reasoning vs static tools:** Unlike cipher lookup tables or brute-force decoders, MystiQ reasons about puzzles — identifying types, suggesting approaches, and brainstorming angles contextually.
- **Geocaching-aware context:** Understands coordinate formats, common mystery cache patterns, and puzzle conventions specific to the hobby.
- **Native-feeling PWA strategy:** Works on any device, installable, fast launch — feels like an app without app store friction.
- **Assistant, not solver:** Provides hints, patterns, and approaches — never dumps raw coordinates.
