# MystiQ

AI-powered mystery puzzle assistant for geocaching enthusiasts.

MystiQ helps you analyze, decode, and brainstorm your way through mystery caches — whether you're on the sofa doing deep research or in the field needing a quick hint.

**What it does:** Identifies puzzle types, detects ciphers and encodings, brainstorms solving approaches, and sanity-checks coordinates. It's your thinking partner, not an auto-solver.

**Who it's for:** Geocachers who enjoy mystery caches and want an intelligent assistant to sharpen their puzzle-solving — without taking the fun away.
